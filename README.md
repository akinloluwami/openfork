# openfork

I created this project a year ago as a way for developers to find open-source projects, since then I haven't really put a lot of effort into building more features into it and getting more people to use it.
Also, it's a year ago and I really don't want to deal with a codebase I wrote a year ago ðŸ˜‚ The way I write code has drastically changed and improved, and so has the tools I build with, so I'm starting afresh.

It is built on NextJS and Supabase with Chakra UI as the component library. The new stack will be:

- NextJS 13
- Postgres
- Prisma
- TailwindCSS (Shadcn UI)

I will publish a roadmap soon.

Since you're here, if you haven't already, please star the repo, it'll mean a lot to me.
